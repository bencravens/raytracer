# raytracer
There's a nice tutorial for implementing a basic ray tracer here: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html. 
It walks you through the implementation of a raytracer in C++.
I'd like to learn the language Rust, and I thought a good idea would be to port this raytracer to Rust.
But because I have never programmed in Rust before, I am going to port the raytracer to Python first (the language I have been coding in for many years and find intuitive) to make sure I understand the raytracer, and then I will port the Python version to Rust.
